    <h1>Antoino Lujano Biography</h1>

    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Antonio Lujano. I was born and raised here in California and after moving to Kansas and living there for a few months I decided to join the Navy. After completing my school I was lucky enough to get stationed back out here California. I served from 2015-2020 and in that time I was lucky enough to meet my awesome girlfriend who I had a kid with last year. Some of my hobbies are hiking, camping, and rock climbing. I was a technician for the gas turbines while I was in the Navy so getting into software development is a total change of pace for me. I hope everyone in the class learns a lot about a new skill or is able to build on a skill they already knew.</p>

<h2><b><i>GOOD LUCK EVERYONE!</i></b></h2>
